# turbo-octo-eureka/Bodex Project

Welcome to the **Bodex** repository! 🎉  
This project demonstrates a custom access gateway built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, combining multiple verification methods to unlock a protected button. Users can:

- Solve a **math CAPTCHA** (or other logic puzzles).
- Enter a **secret passkey**.
- Complete a **Google reCAPTCHA** challenge.

Once verified, the gateway enables a button that redirects to a secure link.  

## ✨ Features
- **Custom CAPTCHA** generator (math or set theory problems).
- **Passkey authentication** for quick access.
- **Google reCAPTCHA integration** for added security.
- Clean, responsive design with CSS styling.
- Modular JavaScript functions for easy extension.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Button.html` → Main page with the gateway UI.
- `styles_button.css` → Styling for the interface.
- `script_button-verify.js` → CAPTCHA and passkey logic.
- `script_Button.js` → Additional button behavior.
