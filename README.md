# turbo-octo-eureka/Bodex Project

Welcome to the **Bodex** repository! 🎉  
This project demonstrates a custom access gateway built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, combining multiple verification methods to unlock a protected button. Users can:

- Complete a **Google reCAPTCHA** challenge.

Once verified, the gateway enables a button that redirects to a secure link.  

## ✨ Features
